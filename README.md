## My Personal Website

Thanks for visiting the website.
I've used the following technologies to build the website:

 1. [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
	 - To create the base for the app.
	 - All the configurations for webpack are being provided from this package.
 2. [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3)
	 - To build the horizontal bar-chart under the Technologies heading.
 3. [Photpea](https://www.photopea.com)
	 - To create the svg logo and the favicon.
